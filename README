Note: This project was started for Gang Garrison 2, but is supposed to be more generic. At the moment, there are special exceptions and legacy protocol implementations in the code, but those should be put into seperate modules later. The code could generally do with some splitting up. Just so you know that things are this way because they were done quickly and by someone with little Python experience (me), not because I think it was good practice.
